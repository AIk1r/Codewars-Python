Codewars solutions (Please leave a star. Thank you)

I decided to collect my approaches to solving problems here. I would appreciate any correction/criticism.

Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until you have completed it yourselves or at least took the time to think about your own approaches

Codewarriors should not submit my solutions as their own

Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars
